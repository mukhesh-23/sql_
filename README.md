# sql_

I used my basic knowledge of SQL to manage and interact with databases in my project.
I created tables using CREATE TABLE and inserted data using INSERT INTO commands.
SELECT queries helped me retrieve specific data based on conditions with WHERE clauses.
I used UPDATE to modify records and DELETE to remove unnecessary data.
Joining tables with INNER JOIN allowed me to fetch related data efficiently.
SQL helped in organizing user details and retrieving results from the database.
I also used ORDER BY and GROUP BY to sort and group data meaningfully.
Overall, SQL helped me handle backend data smoothly and improve the system's functionality.
